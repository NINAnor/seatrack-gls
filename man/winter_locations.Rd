\description{
This function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Estimates twilight times based on a threshold of 1 (for BAS, Biotrack, Lotek, or Migrate Technology devices).
  \item Cleans up the data using an initial sun angle of -5 degrees.
  \item Identifies the sun angle that best matches the "summer track" by comparing tracks calculated with various sun angles to similar dates in the "summer track" and selecting the most similar one.
  \item Recalculates the track using the most corresponding sun angle.
  \item Adds missing dates to the "summer" track.
